<h1>Introduction to Regression<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-regression" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>The goal of regression analysis is to provide accurate mapping from one or
more input variables (called features in machine learning or exogenous
variables in econometrics) to a continuous output variable (called the label or
target in machine learning and the endogenous variable in
econometrics).</p>
<p>In this lecture, we will study some of the most fundamental and widely-used
regression algorithms.</p>
<p>We will follow this same general pattern when we learn each algorithm:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Describe the mathematical foundation for the algorithm</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> python package to
apply the algorithm to a real world dataset on house prices in Washington state</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Linear Regression<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-regression" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Let’s dive in by studying the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">“Hello World”</a> of regression
algorithms: linear regression.</p>
<p>Suppose we would like to predict the log of the sale price of a home, given
only the livable square footage of the home.</p>
<p>The linear regression model for this situation is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\log(\text{price}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{sqft_living} + \epsilon
\]</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \beta_0 \)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \beta_1 \)</span> are called parameters (also coefficients or
weights). The machine learning algorithm is tasked with finding the parameter values
that best fit the data.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \epsilon \)</span> is the error term. It would be unusual for the observed
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \log(\text{price}) \)</span> to be an exact linear function of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \text{sqft_living} \)</span>. The error term captures the deviation of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \log(\text{price}) \)</span> from a linear function of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \text{sqft_living} \)</span>.</p>
<p>The linear regression algorithm will choose the parameters that minimize the
<em>mean squared error</em> (MSE) function, which for our example is written.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\log(\text{price}_i) - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{sqft_living}_i) \right)^2
\]</div>
<p>The output of this algorithm is the straight line (hence linear) that passes as
close to the points on our scatter chart as possible.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sns.lmplot</span></code> function below will plot our scatter chart and draw the
optimal linear regression line through the data.</p>

<h2>Multivariate Linear Regression<a class="headerlink" href="#multivariate-linear-regression" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Our example regression above is called a univariate linear
regression since it uses a single feature.</p>
<p>In practice, more features would be used.</p>
<p>Suppose that in addition to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sqft_living</span></code>, we also wanted to use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bathrooms</span></code> variable.</p>
<p>In this case, the linear regression model is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\log(\text{price}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{sqft_living} +
\beta_2 \text{bathrooms} + \epsilon
\]</div>
<p>We could keep adding one variable at a time, along with a new <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \beta_{j} \)</span> coefficient for the :math:<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">j</span></code>th variable, but there’s an easier way.</p>
<p>Let’s write this equation in vector/matrix form as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \log(\text{price}_1) \\ \log(\text{price}_2) \\ \vdots \\ \log(\text{price}_N)\end{bmatrix}}_Y = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \text{sqft_living}_1 &amp; \text{bathrooms}_1 \\ 1 &amp; \text{sqft_living}_2 &amp; \text{bathrooms}_2 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\ 1 &amp; \text{sqft_living}_N &amp; \text{bathrooms}_N \end{bmatrix}}_{X} \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \beta_0 \\ \beta_1 \\ \beta_2 \end{bmatrix}}_{\beta} + \epsilon
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Notice that we can add as many columns to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( X \)</span> as we’d like and the linear
regression model will still be written <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( Y = X \beta + \epsilon \)</span>.</p>
<p>The mean squared error loss function for the general model is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - X_i \beta)^2 = \frac{1}{N} \| y - X \beta\|_2^2
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( || \cdot ||_2 \)</span> is the <a class="reference external" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/L2-Norm.html">l2-norm</a>.</p>

<h2>Nonlinear Relationships in Linear Regression<a class="headerlink" href="#nonlinear-relationships-in-linear-regression" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>While it sounds like an oxymoron, a linear regression model can actually include non-linear features.</p>
<p>The distinguishing feature of the linear regression model is that each
prediction is generated by taking the dot product (a linear operator) between a
feature vector (one row of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( X \)</span>) and a coefficient vector (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \beta \)</span>).</p>
<p>There is, however, no restriction on what element we include in our feature
vector.</p>
<p>Let’s consider an example…</p>
<p>Starting from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sqft_living</span></code>-only model, suppose we have a hunch that we
should also include the <em>fraction of square feet above ground</em>.</p>
<p>This last variable can be computed as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sqft_above</span> <span class="pre">/</span> <span class="pre">sqft_living</span></code>.</p>
<p>This second feature is nonlinear, but could easily be included as a column in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">X</span></code>.</p>
<p>Let’s see this in action.</p>

<h2>Interpretability<a class="headerlink" href="#interpretability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Before moving to our next regression model, we want to broach the idea of
the <strong>interpretability</strong> of models.</p>
<p>An interpretable model is one for which we can analyze the
coefficients to explain why it makes its predictions.</p>
<p>Recall <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \beta_0 \)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \beta_1 \)</span> from the univariate model.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the model is that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \beta_0 \)</span> captures the notion of
the average or starting house price and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \beta_1 \)</span> is the additional value
per square foot.</p>
<p>Concretely, we have</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>which means that our model predicts the log price of a house to be 12.22, plus
an additional 0.0004 for every square foot.</p>
<p>Using more exotic machine learning methods might potentially be more accurate but
less interpretable.</p>
<p>The accuracy vs interpretability tradeoff is a hot discussion topic, especially relating
to concepts like machine learning ethics. This is something you
should be aware of as you continue to learn about these techniques.</p>

<section id="lasso-regression">
<h1>Lasso Regression<a class="headerlink" href="#lasso-regression" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Lasso regression is very closely related to linear regression.</p>
<p>The lasso model also generates predictions using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( y = X \beta \)</span> but
optimizes over a slightly different loss function.</p>
<p>The optimization problem solved by lasso regression can be written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\min_{\beta} {|| X \beta - y||_2}^2 + \underbrace{\alpha {|| \beta ||_1}}_{\text{new part}}

<p>The additional term penalizes large coefficients and in practice, effectively sets coefficients to zero
for features that are not informative about the
target.</p>

<p>Notice that many coefficients from the lasso regression have been set to
zero.</p>
<p>The intuition here is that the corresponding features hadn’t provided
enough predictive power to be worth considering alongside the other features.</p>
<p>The default value for the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \alpha \)</span> parameter is 1.0.</p>
<p>Larger <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \alpha \)</span> values cause coefficients to shrink (and maybe
additional ones to be thrown out).</p>

<h2>Overfitting and Regularization<a class="headerlink" href="#overfitting-and-regularization" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>You might be wondering, “Why would we ever want to throw variables out,
can’t that only hurt our model?”</p>
<p>The primary answer: it helps us avoid a common issue called <strong>overfitting</strong>.</p>
<p>Overfitting occurs when a model that specializes its coefficients too much on the
data it was trained on, and only to perform poorly when predicting on data
outside the training set.</p>
<p>The extreme example of overfitting is a model that can perfectly memorize the
training data, but can do no better than just randomly guess when predicting
on a new observation.</p>
<p>The techniques applied to reduce overfitting are known as <strong>regularization</strong>.</p>
<p>Regularization is an attempt to limit a model’s ability to specialize too narrowly
on training data (e.g. limit overfitting) by penalizing extreme values of the
model’s parameters.</p>
<p>The additional term in the lasso regression loss function (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \alpha ||\beta||_1 \)</span>)
is a form of regularization.</p>
<p>Let’s demonstrate the overfitting and regularization phenomenon on our housing
price data as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Split the data set into training and testing subsets. We will use the first 50 observations for training and the rest for testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Fit the linear regression model and report MSE on training and testing datasets.</p></li>
<li><p>Fit the lasso model and report the same statistics.</p></li>

<p>Notice how the MSE on the training dataset was smaller for the linear model
without the regularization, but the MSE on the test dataset was much
higher.</p>
<p>This strongly suggests that the linear regression model was
overfitting.</p>
<p>The regularization parameter has a large impact on overfitting.</p>

<h2>Cross-validation of Regularization Parameter<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-validation-of-regularization-parameter" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As you can see in the figure above, the regularization parameter has a
large impact on MSE in the test data.</p>
<p>Moreover, the relationship between the test data MSE and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \alpha \)</span> is
complicated and non-monotonic.</p>
<p>One popular method for choosing the regularization parameter is cross-validation.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, cross-validation splits the dataset into many training/testing
subsets, then chooses the regularization parameter value that minimizes the
average MSE.</p>
<p>More precisely, k-fold cross-validation does the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Partition the dataset randomly into k subsets/”folds”.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( MSE_j(\alpha)= \)</span> mean squared error in j-th subset
when using the j-th subset as test data, and other k-1 as training
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize average (across folds) MSE <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \min_\alpha \frac{1}{k}
\sum_{j=1}^k MSE_j(\alpha) \)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The following code plots 5-fold, cross-validated MSE as a function of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \alpha \)</span>, using the same training data as above.</p>

<h2>Holdout<a class="headerlink" href="#holdout" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Practitioners often use another technique to avoid overfitting, called
<em>holdout</em>.</p>
<p>We demonstrated an extreme example of applying holdout above when we used only
the first 50 observations to train our models.</p>
<p>In general, good practice is to split the entire dataset into a training subset
and testing or validation subset.</p>
<p>The splitting should be done randomly. It should leave enough data in the
training dataset to produce a good model, but also enough in the validation
subset to determine the degree of overfitting.</p>
<p>There aren’t hard and fast rules for how much data to put in each subset, but a
reasonable default uses 75% of the data for training and the
rest for testing.</p>
<p>As in the example above, the training data is often further split
while selecting regularization parameters with cross-validation.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn</span></code> function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">model_selection.train_test_split</span></code> will do this for you:</p>

<h2>Lasso in Econometrics<a class="headerlink" href="#lasso-in-econometrics" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Lasso is becoming increasingly popular in economics, partially due to
the work of Victor Chernozhukov and his coauthors.</p>
<p>In econometrics, the goal is typically to estimate some coefficient of interest or causal
effect, rather than obtaining the most precise prediction.</p>
<p>Among other things, this different goal affects how the regularization parameter
must be chosen.</p>
<p>[<span class="xref myst">regBC11</span>] and [<span class="xref myst">regCHS16</span>] are somewhat approachable introductions
to this area.</p>

<p>Regression trees are formed iteratively.</p>
<p>We begin with a rectangular region <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( R \)</span> containing all values of

<p>We then choose a feature and location to split on, aiming to minimize MSE.</p>

<p>This tree-building algorithm has many variations, but every variation 1) shares some rule to decide on a splitting variable and location and 2) has a stopping rule (though not necessarily the same one).</p>
<p>For example, some algorithms stop splitting into new branches when the improvement
in MSE becomes small.</p>
<p>As with lasso, regression trees also involve some regularization.</p>
<p>In the above description, the minimum leaf size, maximum tree depth, and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \alpha \)</span> in the pruning step serve as regularization
parameters.</p>

<h2>Exercise<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>See exercise 7 in the <span class="xref myst">exercise list</span>.</p>
<p>An advantage of regression trees (and random forests) is that they adapt
automatically to feature scales and units.</p>
<p>For example, including zip code in linear regression or lasso was a little
strange. While zip codes are numerical in value, they actually represent categorical
variables. (i.e. we can compute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10025</span></code> - <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">85001</span></code> (NYC and Phoenix), but the numerical difference is meaningless.)</p>
<p>Including an indicator or dummy variable for each zip code would make more sense.</p>
<p>Regression trees do not impose linearity or even monotonicity, so having the numeric zip code as a feature is
less harmful than it could have been.</p>

<p>Random forests generally produce more accurate predictions than any single
tree.</p>
<p>However, random forests have at least two downsides compared to trees:
longer computation time and more difficulty in interpretation.</p>
<p>We can no longer draw a single decision graph.</p>
<p>Instead, people often report “feature importance” for random forests.</p>
<p>Feature importance is the average MSE decrease caused by splits on each feature.</p>
<p>If a given feature has greater importance, the trees split on that feature more often and/or splitting on that
feature resulted in larger MSE decreases.</p>

<p>The final regression algorithm we will discuss in this lecture is a type of
neural network.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in this course, you have
probably heard about neural networks in the news or social media.</p>
<p>The purpose of this section is not to give an exhaustive overview of the topic,
but instead, to introduce you to a particular neural network model and present
it from a different perspective that hopefully complements materials you may later encounter.</p>

<h2>Mathematical Background<a class="headerlink" href="#mathematical-background" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>If linear regression is the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">“Hello World”</a> of regression
algorithms, then the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is the “Hello World” of neural
networks.</p>
<p>We’ll start with a single (hidden) layer MLP and then build up to the general form.</p>
<p>The prediction function for a single layer MLP is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
y = f_1(X w_1 + b_1) w_2 + b_2
\]</div>
<p>What we have here is <em>nested linear regression</em> (the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( (\cdot) w_i + b_i \)</span>
parts), separated by an <em>activation function</em> (the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( f_1 \)</span>).</p>
<p>Let’s unpack what happens, starting from our <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( N_\text{samples} \times
N_\text{features} \)</span> feature matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( X \)</span>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>First, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( X \)</span> is multiplied by a coefficient matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( w_1 \)</span>. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( w_1 \)</span> is often called the <em>weight matrix</em> or <em>weights</em> for short and has dimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( N_{\text{features}} \times N_1 \)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( b_1 \)</span> is added to each row. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( b_1 \)</span> is often called the <em>bias vector</em> or <em>bias</em> for short and has dimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( N_1 \times 1 \)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( f_1 \)</span> is then applied.

<p>In order to build an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( N \)</span>-hidden layer MLP, we will <em>nest</em> additional linear regressions

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
y = f_{\cdots} \left(f_2(f_1(X w_1 + b_1) w_2 + b_2) w_{\cdots} + b_{\cdots} \right) w_{N+1} + b_{N+1}

<p>We are nearly ready to test out a MLP on our housing data, but there are a few
more talking points to cover:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>[<span class="xref myst">regHSW89</span>] show that MLPs are universal approximators,
meaning they are theoretically capable of approximating any
function. This fact is sometimes stated as though it helps explain
the exceptionally good predictive ability of neural networks. Do not
be fooled by this fallacy. Many other methods are universal approximators,
including regression trees and more classic statistical methods like
kernel regression. The explanation for neural networks’ predictive success
lies elsewhere.  <sup><a href=#rate id=rate-link>[1]</a></sup></p></li>
<li><p>The activation functions must be non-linear. If they were not,
the MLP would be combining linear combinations of linear combinations and
would therefore always be linear.</p></li>
<li><p>The hidden layer structure of an MLP allows it to automatically perform feature engineering.
Contrastly,the example we had above required us to manually engineer
the square feet above ground feature.</p></li>

produced a mean squared error which was tens of thousands of times larger than the
MSE from a linear regression!</p>
</section>
<section id="input-scaling">
<h2>Input Scaling<a class="headerlink" href="#input-scaling" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The issue here is that neural networks are extremely sensitive to the scale
(both relative and absolute) of the input features.</p>
<p>The reasons for why are a bit beyond the scope of this lecture, but the main
idea is that the training procedure pays too much attention to relatively larger
features (relative scale) and becomes unstable if features are very large
(absolute scale).</p>
<p>A common technique to overcome this issue is to scale each variable so that the
observations have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.</p>
<p>This is known as scaling or normalizing the inputs.</p>
</section>
<section id="id9">
<h2>Exercise<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>See exercise 10 in the <span class="xref myst">exercise list</span>.</p>
<p>If we decide to scale our variables, we must remember to apply the same
transformation at prediction time as we did when we fit the model.</p>
<p>In practice, we must do three things:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Store the mean and standard deviation of each feature in the training set.</p></li>
<li><p>Subtract each feature’s mean from the training data and then divide by the feature’s standard deviation before fitting.</p></li>
<li><p>Subtract the <em>training data’s</em> mean and divide by <em>training data’s</em> standard deviation for all prediction inputs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Applying the transformation to the prediction data is easily forgotten, so this is a tedious and
somewhat error-prone process.</p>
<p>Thankfully, scikit-learn has a way to automate the process and ensure that it is
always applied.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example:</p>

<h2>Tradeoffs<a class="headerlink" href="#tradeoffs" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>So we’ve seen that neural networks are very flexible and can approximate highly
nonlinear functions – but they have a few cons.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss a few of them here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Interpretability</strong>: Unlike linear regression or lasso, neural
networks are not easily interpretable. We could look at the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( w \)</span>
matrices or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( b \)</span> vectors, but the nested composition and
nonlinear activation functions make it very difficult to interpret
just how each coefficient impacts the output. In settings like
making economic policy recommendations or decisions with ethical consequences
(e.g. approving loans, screening),
the lack of interpretability can be a non-starter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency/time</strong>: Neural networks require more computational
power to evaluate (generate predictions) and are orders of magnitude
more expensive to train than classical machine learning
methods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automated feature engineering</strong>: The nested linear regressions
allow neural networks to learn data features that are
composed of arbitrary linear combinations of the original feature
set. The non-linear activation functions allow the network to learn
arbitrary non-linear features. Manual feature engineering is based
largely on the researchers intuition, as well as a fair amount of trial and
error. Determining the proper features that allow for more
explanatory power without overfitting is very difficult. Neural
networks automate that process by using the data itself to guide the
training process and select features that satisfy accuracy and
regularization conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overfitting</strong>: Neural networks’ flexibility and explanatory
power make them easy to accidentally overfit. When training neural
networks, the various approaches to regularization should be studied and evaluated,
especially when building networks used for decision-making.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a id=rate href=#rate-link><strong>[1]</strong></a> Two facts about neural networks are relevant to their
predictive success: automatic feature engineering, as
mentioned above, and the ability of neural networks to
approximate a broad (but not quite universal) class of
functions with relatively few parameters. This gives
neural networks its fast statistical convergence
rate. Under appropriate assumptions, lasso, series
regression, and kernel regression share this fast
convergence rate property, but they lack automatic feature
engineering. On the other hand, random forests have automatic feature
engineering, but do not have a fast convergence rate.
Neural networks are somewhat unique in combining both
properties.
See
[these notes and references therein](http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/pschrimpf/628/machineLearningAndCausalInference.html#2_introduction_to_machine_learning)
for more information about convergence rates.</section>
