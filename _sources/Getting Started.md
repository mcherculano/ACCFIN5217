# Getting Started

This 'getting started' guide was taken from a longer and more complete lecture
series on Python programming hosted by [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org).

The idea is that you familiarize yourself with the anaconda-python environment which we will work with before our first Lab so that we can then spend more time discussing the subject.
