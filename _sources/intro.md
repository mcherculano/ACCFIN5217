# ECON5129 Labs

The Labs for your ECON5129 Statistical Machine Learning course will take place every Thursday at 2pm. 

It would be ideal if you could bring along your laptop with anaconda-python installed. Please read through the Getting Started section of these notes, install and get familiar with anaconda (I will not go through these extensively in class). Don't stress if you don't have a laptop; the room where the Labs are taking place should have plenty of computers. 

Please address any academic enquiries to [miguel.herculano@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:miguel.herculano@glasgow.ac.uk).
