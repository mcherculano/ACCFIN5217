# 1. Introduction to Regression & MLE 
In this Lab we will use publicly available data to explore the subjects of i) Regression and ii) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) in more detail. For the first topic, we will borrow from [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org). There are many other resources on Regression available on their website which I encourage you to explore. For maximum likelihood I will follow a notebook prepared by [Paul Schrimpf](https://economics.ubc.ca/faculty-and-staff/paul-schrimpf/).
